<h2>Description</h2>

<p>There are many animals in the zoo: all of them need care, and some of them are endangered and require preservation efforts. Animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin and kept happy. That it a difficult task for such a big open-range zoo, so one of your employers suggested a more convenient way to accomplish that. She wants to be able to watch any animal on the screen with the help of a special program. It will sure help her take care of our furry friends more efficiently!</p>

<p>In this project, you will create a program that helps the zookeeper check on the animals and see that they&#39;re well. Your product will be able to understand commands from the zoo staff and show the animals on a monitor.</p>

<p>To begin with, you will develop a simple printer.</p>

<p>Your program must show the following text:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-no-highlight">I do love animals!
Start looking after animals...
Deer looks fine.
Bat looks happy.
Lion looks healthy.</code></pre>
